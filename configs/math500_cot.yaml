  - question: |
      Find $n$ if $n\\cdot n! + n! = 720$, where $n! = n\\cdot (n-1)\\cdot (n-2)\\cdots 2\\cdot 1$.
    answer: |
      We can factor n! out of the left-hand side: \\begin{align*}\nn\\cdot n! +n! &= (n+1)(n!)\\\\\n&= (n+1)!\\\\\n\\end{align*}We see that $(n+1)! = 720 = 6!$,  so $n+1 = 6$ and $n = \\boxed{5}$.

      Evaluate\n\\[\\begin{vmatrix} \\cos \\alpha \\cos \\beta & \\cos \\alpha \\sin \\beta & -\\sin \\alpha \\\\ -\\sin \\beta & \\cos \\beta & 0 \\\\ \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\beta & \\sin \\alpha \\sin \\beta & \\cos \\alpha \\end{vmatrix}.\\]
    answer: |
      We can expand the determinant as follows:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\begin{vmatrix} \\cos \\alpha \\cos \\beta & \\cos \\alpha \\sin \\beta & -\\sin \\alpha \\\\ -\\sin \\beta & \\cos \\beta & 0 \\\\ \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\beta & \\sin \\alpha \\sin \\beta & \\cos \\alpha \\end{vmatrix} &= \\cos \\alpha \\cos \\beta \\begin{vmatrix} \\cos \\beta & 0 \\\\ \\sin \\alpha \\sin \\beta & \\cos \\alpha \\end{vmatrix} \\\\\n&\\quad - \\cos \\alpha \\sin \\beta \\begin{vmatrix} -\\sin \\beta & 0 \\\\ \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\beta & \\cos \\alpha \\end{vmatrix} - \\sin \\alpha \\begin{vmatrix} -\\sin \\beta & \\cos \\beta \\\\ \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\beta & \\sin \\alpha \\sin \\beta \\end{vmatrix} \\\\\n&= \\cos \\alpha \\cos \\beta (\\cos \\beta \\cos \\alpha) - \\cos \\alpha \\sin \\beta (-\\sin \\beta \\cos \\alpha) \\\\\n&\\quad - \\sin \\alpha ((-\\sin \\beta)(\\sin \\alpha \\sin \\beta) - (\\cos \\beta)(\\sin \\alpha \\cos \\beta)) \\\\\n&= \\cos^2 \\alpha \\cos^2 \\beta + \\cos^2 \\alpha \\sin^2 \\beta + \\sin^2 \\alpha \\sin^2 \\beta + \\sin^2 \\alpha \\cos^2 \\beta \\\\\n&= (\\cos^2 \\alpha + \\sin^2 \\alpha)(\\cos^2 \\beta + \\sin^2 \\beta) \\\\\n&= \\boxed{1}.\n\\end{align*}
  - question: |
      Find all real solutions to\n\\[\\frac{1}{(x - 1)(x - 2)} + \\frac{1}{(x - 2)(x - 3)} + \\frac{1}{(x - 3)(x - 4)} = \\frac{1}{6}.\\]Enter all solutions, separated by commas.
    answer: |
      By partial fractions,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{(x - 1)(x - 2)} &= \\frac{1}{x - 2} - \\frac{1}{x - 1}, \\\\\n\\frac{1}{(x - 2)(x - 3)} &= \\frac{1}{x - 3} - \\frac{1}{x - 2}, \\\\\n\\frac{1}{(x - 3)(x - 4)} &= \\frac{1}{x - 4} - \\frac{1}{x - 3},\n\\end{align*}so the given equation reduces to\n\\[\\frac{1}{x - 4} - \\frac{1}{x - 1} = \\frac{1}{6}.\\]Multiplying both sides by $6(x - 4)(x - 1),$ we get\n\\[6(x - 1) - 6(x - 4) = (x - 4)(x - 1),\\]which simplifies to $x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0.$  This factors as $(x - 7)(x + 2) = 0,$ so the solutions are $\\boxed{7,-2}.$
  - question:
      Write the expression $\\frac{4+3c}{7}+2$ as a single fraction.
    answer: |
      In order to combine the fraction and the integer into a single fraction, we write $2$ as a fraction with a denominator of $7$, or $\\frac{14}{7}$. We get \\[\\frac{4+3c}{7}+\\frac{14}{7}=\\frac{4+3c+14}{7}=\\boxed{\\frac{18+3c}{7}}.\\]
  - question: |
      An integer $n$ is said to be square-free if the only perfect square that divides $n$ is $1^2$. How many positive odd integers greater than 1 and less than $100$ are square-free?
    answer: |
      If an integer $n$ is not square-free, then there is a square greater than $1$ that does divide $n$. The odd squares less than $100$ are $3^2 = 9$, $5^2 = 25$, $7^2 = 49$, and $9^2 = 81$. If an integer is divisible by $81$, then it is divisible by $9$, so we will only consider $3^2$, $5^2$, and $7^2$. There are $11$ multiples of $9$ that are less than $100$. Six of them are odd and five are even. There are $3$ multiples of $25$ that are less than $100$. Two of them are odd and one is even. There are $2$ multiples of $49$ that are less than $100$. One of them is odd and one is even. Therefore, there are $9$ odd integers that are not square-free. The least integer which is divisible by at least two of the integers 9, 25, and 49 is $9\\cdot 25 = 225$, which is greater than 100. Therefore, there are 9 odd integers less than 100 which are divisible by a perfect square greater than 1. There are $49$ odd integers less than $100$ and greater than 1, so there are $49-9=\\boxed{40}$ odd square-free integers less than $100$.
